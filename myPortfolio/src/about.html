    <p>I am a 34 year old Indian-American web development student from Lubbock,TX. I graduated from Texas Tech University in 2009 with a Bachelor's of Science 
        in Biology and a minor in Chemistry. I was in the medical school track, however later on I decided a career in computers, information technology, 
        and web development would be a much better fit for me! I really enjoyed math subjects in my high school and college career such as algebra, trigonometry, statistics,
    and calculus. I enjoy the logic and though process required to be successful in mathematics and I think there is a very similar or strong correlation between
logical thought patterns and IT web development as well! There's usually more than one way to solve a problem and there is always an empirical concrete answer to a problem, 
is no or not much subjectivity like having to analyze an author's thesis in a novel. My other interests and hobbies include but are not limited to: movies, television,
video games, politics, cooking, and especially sports! </p>
